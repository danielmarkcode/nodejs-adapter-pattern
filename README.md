# nodejs-adapter-pattern
The Adapter pattern is a design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one object into an interface that another object expects. In the context of integrating two payment APIs in Node.js, an Adapter could be used to make calls to one API using the interface of the other API.
